# Website of Alan Wong, Developer

This project is online at [https://captainalan.github.io/me/](https://captainalan.github.io/me/).

## Notes to self

For this project, I am trying `yarn` (rather than `npm`) for package management.

To put things on the interwebs, do:

```bash
yarn predeploy
yarn deploy
```

This will run the scripts to build and publish this site to Github Pages.

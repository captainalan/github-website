# Reactjs Website of Alan Wong, Developer

This project is online at [https://captainalan.github.io/me/](https://captainalan.github.io/me/).

My main homepage is online [here](https://captainalan.github.io/), but I'm also working on this site to improve my skills using modern  frontend tooling (e.g. React, CSS3 features).

## Notes to self

For this project, I am trying `yarn` (rather than `npm`) for package management.

To put things on the interwebs, do:

```bash
yarn predeploy
yarn deploy
```

This will run the scripts to build and publish this site to Github Pages.

## TODO

Updates planned for this project include

- [ ] Put content on external "API" (host (static) JSON on Github)
- [ ] Use AJAX in React hooks to get content
- [x] Refactor components into separate files (try making a `src/components/` directory)
- [ ] Find and use best practices for image src links

Even more elaborate

- [ ] Fetch XML and dynamically display blog content
